          A company limited by guarantee (CLG): Commonly used where companies
          are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities.
          The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts
          if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they
          have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of
          company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be
          with or without having share capital. A company limited by shares: The
          most common form of the company used for business ventures.
          Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability
          of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested"
          with corporations being "the most common example of a limited
          company".[9] This type of company is common in England and many
          English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
          publicly traded company or a privately held company.
